I have dedicated several years to specializing in cybersecurity risk assessment.
Everything can be automated. As by recent security requirements I suggest using OS builtin interpreter for automation calls. That will simplify the required uplifts.
Worked many years day to day with SDLC, All network protocols + securing them
